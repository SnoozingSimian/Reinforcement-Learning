# Reinforcement-Learning-Forages 
My work on introductory reinforcement learning.

I intend to create pdfs of my notes on RL which I created while going through the course on NPTEL. I also intend to put up my own solutions to the questions from the Sutton and Barto book and write code in a way that is simple and comprehensible for anyone going through it instead of optimizing for speed/performance. (Will try to use comments as far as possible)

You are free to use this material as you wish.
